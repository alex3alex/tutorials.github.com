tutorials.github.com
====================

tutorials.github.com is a simple hack that uses GitHub Pages to fulfill a need of mine: collecting disparate tutorials and allowing others to easily fork them so the full range of languages and systems is covered.

Examples
========

* [Installing MySQL](http://tutorials.github.com/pages/installing-mysql.html)
* [Hello, World!](http://tutorials.github.com/pages/hello-world.html "Hello, World!")
* [Syntax explanation](http://tutorials.github.com/pages/explanation.html)
