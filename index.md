README
======

tutorials.github.com is a simple hack that uses GitHub Pages to fulfill a need of mine: collecting disparate tutorials and allowing others to easily fork them so the full range of languages and systems is covered.

For now, each topic is its own page, and you use the sidebar navigation to drill down into a variant that's most useful to you.  It might not look like it, but __the navigation is clickable!__  Try clicking on a language in the [Hello, World!](/pages/hello-world.html) example to get a feel for the navigation.

In the future, I'll add cookies so the site will apply filters for you and a central collection of tags/values so we have some consistency across various tutorials.

This project originated as a full-blown rails app backed by a database, and I reached a point where I needed user accounts and git repos.  Dreading that, I threw it all away for a simpler, git-based workflow to upload data.  I sincerely hope you enjoy it and find it useful.
